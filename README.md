# DSA Lab

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab repository! This lab is designed to help you learn, practice, and experiment with various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science.

## Getting Started

In this repository, you'll find code examples and implementations for fundamental data structures and algorithms. Whether you are a student looking to reinforce your DSA skills or a developer seeking reference material, this lab provides a foundation for your DSA journey.

## Contents

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Explore basic data structures like stack, queue, linked list, tree, binary search tree, hash table, and graph.
   - Understand how these data structures work, and find sample implementations in the code files.

2. **Algorithms**:
   - Learn various searching and sorting algorithms.
   - Discover dynamic programming techniques and graph algorithms.

3. **How to Use**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Lab.git
     ```
   - Dive into the specific data structure or algorithm you want to study.
   - Run the code examples and adapt them for your projects.

4. **Contributions**:
   - Contributions to this repository are welcome!
   - If you have additional data structures, algorithms, or improvements to existing code, please submit a pull request.
